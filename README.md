# NLPcapstone
This project was made partially to server my Engineering capstone as a proof of concept.
I implemented Apache's natural language model (Apache Open NLP) found here https://opennlp.apache.org/ into a backend system. How it works is that you would store training data via API ("/consumer"). The training data can be found in src/main/training_data/. Once the training data is uploaded, it is stored in a MongoDB database on the cloud then that data can be put through all the NLP techniques (detection, tokenization, stemming, lemmatize etc) via another API. I played around with breaking these steps apart in multiple API's so I can demo the process, but it usually works via one request to an API that triggers the entire process.<br><br/>I made it accept training data via API because I wanted to make a program that trains an NLP model on dynamic data, and prove this method can be used for more than just Instagram Posts. However currently it works to train data for instagram captions & image 'alt' values in order to give social media users some creative ideas on what to post next.
